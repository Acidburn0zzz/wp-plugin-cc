============

WPLicense (name may change) is a WordPress plugin, helping you license your WordPress content with the appropriate Creative Commons license. 

## Current status
Currently the plugin is considered unstable and not yet ready for production. 
Feel free to help us make the plugin more stable by testing the plugin and reporting bugs.

Download the latest:
[release-2.0-alpha](https://github.com/tarmot/wp-cc-plugin/releases/tag/release-2.0-alpha)

Send any feedback using Github's issue tracker, or send an email to burobjorn@gmail.com

## Features 
- License your blog (single WordPress install)
- License your WordPress Network (WordPress Multisite install)
- License some of your sites differently in your WordPress Network
- License all your content with the same license (license per author)
- License some posts or page differently from your default license (per content license) 
- Prevent license changes in your WordPress Network (all content on all sites need to use the same license)
- Prevent license changes per site (all content on a site must use the same license) 

At this moment the plugin allows you to license WordPress content such as posts and pages but no media files (yet).

_Possible future features_
Here's a list of some features we'd love to add to this plugin or support in a separate (child) plugin. 

- Allow media files to be licensed 
- Allow to search (using external search engines) for specific Creative Commons licensed media files 

## History 
WPLicense is loosely based on an existing, but seemingly abandoned Wordpress plugin named 'License' (a component of the [MIT Educational Collaboration Space](http://ecs.mit.edu) project) 
by mitcho (Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine) & Brett Mellor. WPLicense is also inspired by Creative Commons' original WPLicense plugin written by former Creative Commons CTO Nathan Yergler.    


## Development
If you're interested in the code have a look at the master branch for the releases. Development will be done in the development branch. 
Occasionally other branches may be available to test new features or play with new ideas, but they may be deleted anytime so don't rely on those branches.
