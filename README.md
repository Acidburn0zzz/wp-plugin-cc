## Features 

- License your blog (single WordPress install)
- License your WordPress Network (WordPress Multisite install)
- License some of your sites differently in your WordPress Network
- License all your content with the same license (license per author)
- License some posts or page differently from your default license (per content license) 
- Prevent license changes in your WordPress Network (all content on all sites need to use the same license)
- Prevent license changes per site (all content on a site must use the same license) 

At this moment the plugin allows you to license WordPress content such as posts and pages but no media files (yet).

*Possible future features*

Here's a list of some features we'd love to add to this
plugin or support in a separate (child) plugin. If
you'd like these or other features to be implemented
you may consider supporting this plugin with code
contributions, testing or funding Creative Commons for
further development.

- Allow media files to be licensed 

- Allow to search (using external search engines) for
  specific Creative Commons licensed media files

## History 

This plugin is loosely based on an existing, but
seemingly abandoned WordPress plugin named 'License' (a
component of the
[MIT Educational Collaboration Space](http://ecs.mit.edu)
project) by mitcho (Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine) & Brett
Mellor. We're also inspired by Creative Commons'
original WPLicense plugin written by former Creative
Commons CTO Nathan Yergler.


## Development

If you're interested in the code have a look at the
master branch for the releases. Development will be
done in the development branch.

Occasionally other branches may be available to test
new features or play with new ideas, but they may be
deleted anytime so don't rely on those branches.
