Creative Commons plugin for WordPress

This is a WordPress plugin to assist you to choose a Creative Commons license
for your blog or website.

Download the latest version from this projects [releases][releases].

[releases]: https://github.com/creativecommons/creativecommons-wordpress-plugin/releases "Releases Â· creativecommons/creativecommons-wordpress-plugin"


## Features

- License your blog (single WordPress install)
- License your WordPress Network (WordPress Multisite install)
- License some of your sites differently in your WordPress Network
- License all your content with the same license (license per author)
- License some posts or page differently from your default license (per content
  license)
- Prevent license changes in your WordPress Network (all content on all sites
  need to use the same license)
- Prevent license changes per site (all content on a site must use the same
  license)

At this moment the plugin allows you to license WordPress content such as posts
and pages but no media files (yet).


### Possible future features

Here's a list of some features we'd love to add to this plugin or support in a
separate (child) plugin. If you'd like these or other features to be
implemented you may consider supporting this plugin with code contributions,
testing or funding Creative Commons for further development.

- Allow media files to be licensed
- Allow to search (using external search engines) for specific Creative Commons
  licensed media files

## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Development

If you're interested in the code have a look at the master branch for the
releases. Development will be done in the development branch.

Occasionally other branches may be available to test new features or play with
new ideas, but they may be deleted anytime so don't rely on those branches.


## History

This plugin is loosely based on an existing, but seemingly abandoned WordPress
plugin named 'License' (a component of the [MIT Educational Collaboration
Space][collabspace] project) by mitcho (Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine) and
Brett Mellor. We're also inspired by Creative Commons' original
[wordpress-cc-plugin][oldplugin] written by former Creative Commons CTO Nathan
Yergler.
